### Question 1

A small international team of researchers has found that it is possible to test navigation skills in

[[chimpanzees]]

using virtual reality technology.

### Question 2

Where do the chimpanzees come from?

[[ ]] China
[[ ]] USA
[[X]] Germany

### Question 3

The chimps were then invited to play another type of .....

[[ ]] chess game
[[X]] video game
[[ ]] ball game

### Question 4

How did the chimps navigate through the game?

[[ ]] Joystick
[[X]] Touchscreen
[[ ]] Keyboard and Mouse

### Question 5

[[X]] The chimps have to reach the same tree every time.
[[ ]] The Chimps have to navigate to fruits and eat them.
[[ ]] The Chimps have to navigate through a virtual copy of their real Zoo.

### Question 6

They get

[[fruit]]

in real world as a reward.

### Question 7

The Chimps learned to make their way through the

[[virtual jungle]]

to reach their destination.

### Question 8

Discuss how this research is helpful for future.

### Question 1

What is the mathematical description of mental updating and mathematics of information used for?

- [[ ]] to model the behavior of animals
- [[x]] to model the behavior of financial markets
- [[X]] to model the behavior of green plants
- [[x]] to model the dynamics of opinion poll statistics associated with an election or a referendum

### Question 2

If a person has a very strong conviction on one alternative, then whatever the information says their position will hardly change, due to the ____________.

[[confirmation bias]]

### Question 3

"If someone has a very strong conviction on one of the alternatives, then whatever the information says, their position will hardly change for a long time."

Is this a contradiction to the Bayes logic?

 - [[x]] no
 - [[ ]] yes

### Question 4

What describes the behavior of a pathological liar?

- [[ ]] If a person knows the truth but refuses to accept it  they will rapidly choose one of the false alternatives and confidently assert this to be the truth. Then, as the truth is gradually revealed and this position becomes untenable, very quickly and assertively they will pick another false alternative.
- [[x]] If a person genuinely thinks an alternative that is obviously true is highly unlikely then in an environment in which partial information about the truth is gradually revealed, their perception will slowly shift towards the truth. Even if they have a strong belief in a false alternative, their view will very slowly converge from this false alternative to the true one.

### Question 5

If a person genuinely thinks an alternative that is obviously true is highly unlikely they are:

- [[X]] misunderstanding
- [[ ]] lying

### Question 6

Which mathematician inspired this model?

- [[ ]] Jakob Berliner
- [[x]] Norbert Wiener
- [[ ]] Georg Pariser

### Question 7

According to Bayes ______ can strongly influence our behavior.

[[every alternative]]
