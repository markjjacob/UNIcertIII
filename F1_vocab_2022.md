# English Vocab Quiz

The following Quiz is made by the students of faculty one. Those are studying maths, computer science and robotics. So obviously the questions are related to those fields.

The Quiz should help us to learn the 64 words which we have to know for our exam. 

But it can also be good fun for everyone who wants to test their knowledge about those topics. 

## 1. 

1. It is the part of the CPU (central processing unit) where intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored.

[[Accumulator]]

## 2.

[[Actuator]]


## 3.
It is a 7-bit character set consisting of 128 different letters, numbers or punctuation symbols. Every character has a corresponding number, or a code.

[[ASCII]]

## 4.

A special robot which is built to interact with human workers. It is built by the Company Rethink Robots. It should do simple tasks like taking, pull up, support the workers. Therefore it has a display where eyes are pictured for showing human workers (how about) the state and the next step of the robot.

[[Baxter Robot]]

## 5. 

A quick way to refer to the massive amounts of information collected by organizations on a day-to-day basis. At this scale it can be tapped into for a variety of purposes like trend analyses, forecasting, process automation and more.

[[Big Data]]

## 6.

It is the number system used by computers and can be converted into a language humans understand, so base 10 numbers (the number system we usually use), letters etc.

[[Binary]]

## 7.

An interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. It combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics. Common used include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphism. 

[[Bioinformatics]]

## 8.

An application of biological systems and methods found in nature to study and design of engineering systems and modern technologies. In robotics, it is used to apply the way animals move to the design of robots.

[[Bionics]]

## 9.

A celestial object that has a gravitational field so strong that even light cannot escape it. Some of these are created by collapse of a very massive star. 

[[Black Hole]]

## 10.

[[Braitenberg Vehicle]]

## 11. 

A programming error that causes unexpected glitches or problems for a program’s end user. The name comes from early programmers and engineers who jokingly asumed that there where small insects crawling around inside the machine which destroyed the small circuits inside. 

[[Bug]]

## 12.

Responsible for handling and executing all the instructions received from the computer’s soft- and hardware.

[[Central Processing Unit]]

## 13 

Robots intended for direct human robot interaction within a shared space, or where humans and robots are in close proximity. Their applications contrast with traditional industrial robot applications in which robots are isolated from human contact. 

[[Cobot]]

## 14.

[[Controller]]

## 15.

Text files with small pieces of data, like a username and password, that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. 

[[Cookies]]

## 16.

[[Cyborg]]

## 17.

Number of independent coordinates (not including time) necessary for the complete description of the pose of a mechanical system. The number of independent ways the end-effector can move. Number of translational and rotational robot joints. 

[[Degree of freedom]]

## 18.

Gives the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable and has a quite high importance in mathematics. It is used to find local extrem points or to solve differential equations. To find the extrem values of a function you have to calculate the values where it is zero and the regard the monotony behaviour of the function to find out if it is a maximum or a minimum. 

[[Derivative]]

## 19. 

A process where the position of an object is determined by emitting a signal and seeing how long before that signal returns.
Like a bat, by emitting sound waves and receiving reflected ones to locate objects.

[[Echo Location]]

## 20.

The operation of a circuit using hardware-based components that overrides all other Robot controls, removes drive power from the robot Actuators, and causes all moving parts to stop. 

[[Emergency Stop]]


## 1
What is each rotation axis called?

Vertical axis:
[[Yaw axis|Pitch axis|Roll axis]]

Left-to-right:
[[Yaw axis|Pitch axis|Roll axis]]

Front-to-back:
[[Yaw axis|Pitch axis|Roll axis]]

## 2

A ____  is a program that visits Web sites and reads their pages and other information in order to create entries for a search engine index. 

[[crawler]]

What is it called?

[[Unicode]]

{{1}}
Unicode is an encoding format that allocates a numeric code to characters in order for them to be represented in binary within a computer system. It covers the characters for most known alphabets and special symbols (e.g. mathematical operators, geometric shapes, arrows, emojis, etc.). Before Unicode was established there were many different systems of character encoding therefore international work was rather difficult. Unicode was developed as a global standard to support all the word's languages.

## 4

What is it called?

[[Truth table]]

{{1}}
A table showing the outputs for all possible combinations of inputs to a logic gate or a circuit made up of logic gates. They are often used in connection with Boolean Functions.
[More information on truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table "More information on truth tables")



## 5

How do you call a technical device which converts a signal from one form of energy into another?

[[Transducer]]

{{1}}
The first transducer - a hydrophone - was invented in 1915 by Paul Langevin. There are two basic types of transducers: input transducers called sensors and output transducers which are Actuators. Examples for transducers are microphones and loudspeakers.
