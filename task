# Workshop task sequence

## OVERALL LEARNING GOALS:

- Being able to identify the linguistic features of a scientific abstract.
- Can formulate a main research question and a subset of analytical questions on a narrowed-down scientific topic.
- They can assess the suitability of an abstract for providing answers to some of the analytical questions.

## Tasks

### Classroom Discussion

> Does the word ‘abstract’ bring to mind?
> *[Can it be used as a noun too? What does it mean then?]*

### Pair/Group activity

Give out examples of abstracts from different research papers.

What do you notice about:

The language (e.g. technical vocabulary, register, syntax etc.)

Structure and layout (e.g., are there any paragraphs? Does it have a clear lead-in and/or a conclusion? Does it have any other parts? What are these about?)

Content (e.g., what facts are mentioned? Are there any opinions?)

#### Feedback round

### Discussion:

    Based on the abstract you just read, what would you expect to find in the article?


### Individual task:

    Write questions that you would like to find the answers to in the article


#### Group activity:

    Pool the questions together within the group and have them decide collectively on at least ONE good question per participant.


### Discussion:

    Have you ever looked up journal articles on the university catalogue?


### Setting up the homework:

    Give students from each group access to the original article.

    Ask them to find answers to the questions.
